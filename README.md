The wireframes were created for the following pages: Home, Register, Login, Profile, Add Book, Edit Book, Delete Book, Book Details, Favourites, User Added Books, Contact, and 404.

N.B. The wireframes were created before the project was started. The final project will abundantly differ from the wireframes.

![colour scheme](./docs/images/colour_scheme.png)

This colour scheme is used throughout the website. To it the standard Bootstrap colours are added. It is a nice and clean colour scheme that is easy on the eyes and doesn't disctract the user from the content.

##### Typography

Monserrat Alternates is used for the logo and headings. Roboto Serif is used for the body text. Mooli is used for the book titles. They are all Google Fonts.
